# README

### TODO:
  - Rails
    - Remove unnecessary/unused JBuilder views & controller actions
    - Store `Reward#percentage` properly (TBD)
      - Or maybe store # points/miles back per 1$ spend?
    - Revisit efficiency of GraphQL index queries
  - React/Redux:
    - Figure out Selectors
    - Refactor repeated `buildIdMap` function in reducers
    - Avoid NaN warning when spendInput input is empty
